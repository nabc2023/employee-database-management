Employee Database Management
Description: This project implements a simple console-based employee database management system. It allows you to add employees to the database, save and load the database from a file, and print the employee records.

Instructions:

1. Open the C# file and compile the code using a C# compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or .NET CLI).
2. Run the executable; it will load the existing employee database from employee_database.txt, if available.
3. Use the provided methods (e.g., AddEmployee, PrintAllEmployees) to manipulate the employee database.
4. When you finish managing employees, call SaveDatabase to save the updated database back to the employee_database.txt file.
